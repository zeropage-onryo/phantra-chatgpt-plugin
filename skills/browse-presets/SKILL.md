description: Shows the person what Phantra can do before anything is made: the effects menu (image edits, animated templates, camera moves, upscales, sound, cut-outs), the saved recipes, and the image and video models. Browsing costs nothing and starts nothing; it ends with the person picking one. Use when someone asks what is possible, what effects, templates, camera moves, styles or models there are, "show me the options", or wants to browse before choosing. NOT for running an effect (effects), pricing a scene (price-and-render) or choosing the best model for a job (model-prompting).

# Browse presets

Browsing is free and changes nothing. Looking at a menu never starts an
effect, a still or a render: running one is a separate step, quoted in
credits first, and only on the person's yes. Say that once, in one line, if
they seem unsure.

## 1. Find out what they want to browse

Ask only if it is not clear. Four shelves exist:

| they want to see | read |
|---|---|
| ways to change something already made, animate a still, add a camera move, upscale, add sound, cut out a subject | `effects` |
| ways of working, saved by the studio or by them | `recipes` |
| image makers and what each is good at | `image_models` |
| video makers, lengths and what each costs per second | `video_models` |

"What can you do?" is all four, kept short: one line each, then ask which
shelf to open.

## 2. Read the menu, never recite it from memory

- `effects` lists what exists today. `category` narrows it: `image_edit`,
  `video_effect`, `camera`, `finish`. Name an effect only from a row you
  just read; one the menu does not list is not available.
- `recipes` lists names with one line each. `recipe` with a name opens one.
- `image_models` and `video_models` list what the studio runs now, with
  lengths, shapes and prices in credits.

If a list is long, show the five or six that fit what they said they are
making and offer more. Never paste a whole menu.

## 3. Show each choice the way a person would pick it

For every item give: its name, what it does in plain words, what it needs
(an image, a clip, a prompt) and, when the menu gives one, its price in
credits at default options. A price read here is a guide, not a quote: some
depend on the clip. Do not call it the price.

Offer to make it concrete: with their own material, `library` lists what they
have (`gen:<id>` and `asset:<id>`), and a photo not in it yet comes in through
`upload_link`. An effect needs something to act on, so ask what to try it on.

## 4. When they pick one

- An effect: hand over to the `effects` skill. Quote, wait for yes, then run.
- A recipe: open it with `recipe` and follow it as the person's own way of
  working, quoting anything that costs before it runs.
- A model: if they want a recommendation for a job, use `recommend_model`
  with the job in words; the choice stays theirs.
- Nothing yet: leave it open. Offer to keep browsing another shelf.

## The rules

- Browsing never authorizes spending. A "that looks great" is not a yes to a
  price they have not seen; quote it, then wait.
- Never invent an effect, template, camera move, model or price. If the menu
  does not list it, say so and show what is close.
- Never run anything while browsing, even to "show what it looks like". An
  example costs credits like any other run, and needs its own quote and yes.
- Credits are the only unit: never give dollars or compare plans.
