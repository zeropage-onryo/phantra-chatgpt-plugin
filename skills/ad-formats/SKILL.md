name: ad-formats
description: Pick the shape of a short ad in Phantra and turn it into a shot plan -- product spot, demo, before/after, problem-solution, unboxing, comparison of the person's own products, teaser -- each with its length, shot count, the photos it is held to and a `write_scene` shape, with `duplicate_scene` for variants. Use when someone says "make an ad", names one of these shapes, or asks which format suits their product. NOT for writing the whole scene prompt (write-scene), NOT for a creator talking to camera or filming their own review, unboxing, how-to or try-on (ugc-ad, ugc-review, ugc-unboxing, ugc-tutorial, ugc-try-on), NOT for a still packshot (product-shots), NOT for a set of stills and hooks from one product photo (product-ad-set), NOT for cutting variants of a finished ad (ad-variations), and NOT for pricing or rendering (price-and-hand-off).

# Ad formats

An ad here is one scene: 4 to 30 seconds of timed shots, held to the person's
own photos of the product, the place and any face. The shape decides the
shots. Choosing it and writing the scene spends nothing; the render is quoted
in credits and started only on the person's yes (price-and-hand-off).

## Before choosing

1. `elements`: which photos exist. Every shape below is held to the product's
   photo as the FIRST ref (the anchor) unless the table says otherwise; a face
   or a room needs its own element. Missing one: `add_element` with a picture
   the person gave you, or `upload_link` for a file on their device.
2. What the ad must say comes from the person. Never invent a benefit, a
   number, a review, a rating or an award; if they did not say it, the ad does
   not say it. Ask once, then use their words.
3. Length: `preferences` holds the default `seconds`, used when `write_scene`
   is passed none. The studio renders in its own vertical frame; other shapes
   are free `reformat` copies afterwards (platform-delivery).

## The seven shapes

| shape | length | shots | held to (refs, anchor first) | the beats |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| product spot | 6-10s | 2-3 | product, place | reveal; one detail; the product at rest |
| demo | 10-15s | 3-4 | product, hands or face, place | in use, one step per shot; the result |
| before/after | 8-12s | 2 | place or product, the same setup twice | the state before; hard cut to the same framing after |
| problem-solution | 10-15s | 3 | face or hands, product | the trouble; the product arrives; the trouble gone |
| unboxing | 10-20s | 3-5 | product, hands | the box; the opening; the product out; one close detail |
| comparison | 10-15s | 3 | two of the person's own products | A; B; the one difference the person named |
| teaser | 4-8s | 1-2 | product or place | one striking detail, the product withheld or half-shown |

Every window is ONE shot (one camera setup, one action, 2 to 10 seconds).
Roles say what each photo is for: `product` for the product's photo, `place`
for the room, `subject` for a face. A before/after keeps the same framing in
both windows, and says so. A comparison is never against another brand.

## The `write_scene` shape

A product spot, 8 seconds, two shots (replace everything in it):

```
Ultra-realistic grounded product film in 9:16. The attached photo of the Tern
bottle is the exact product; the attached photo of the kitchen is the exact
place. Style: morning window light from the left, true colour with a gentle
roll-off in the highlights, a 50mm frame at counter height, shallow depth on
the close shot, brushed steel and real condensation.
(0-4s) The bottle stands on the counter in a slow push-in; a bead of water
runs down the steel.
(4-8s) Hard cut to a hand lifting it out of frame; the ring of water it leaves
catches the light. End abruptly.
No background music. Only diegetic sound: the bottle's base on stone, the
room's quiet.
Avoid: plastic AI sheen, CGI-looking surfaces, on-screen text, prices or
captions, named brands or actors.
```

Show it to the person, take their edits, then `write_scene` with `prompt`,
`seconds` 8, `refs` [the bottle's ref, the kitchen's ref], `roles` {the
kitchen's ref: "place"}, a `title`, and `project_id` when it belongs to a
project. Nothing is spent. Then `quote` it (the keyframes and one render per
shot, in credits), show the person the price, and only on their yes `approve`
with the quote's `tokens` and the same renderer choice; `job` until done, then
`scene` for the clips (price-and-hand-off).

## Variants

`duplicate_scene` with the saved `scene_id` and only what changes: a new
`prompt` for another shape on the same product, `seconds`, or `refs` for a
second colour or a second room. What you do not pass is copied; stills and
clips never are, so each copy is a fresh scene to price. One copy per
variant, each shown to the person before it is saved.

## Do not

- Never write a claim, a price, a rating, a review or a competitor the person
  did not give you.
- Never ask the model to draw on-screen text, prices or captions.
- Never write a window longer than 10 seconds or shorter than 2.
- A scene with no photo at all is saved as a draft and cannot be priced until
  one is on it (`add_element`, then `write_scene` again with its `scene_id`,
  the same prompt and the `refs`). Every shape above is held to the product's
  photo, so get that photo first.
